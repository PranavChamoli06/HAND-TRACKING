# HAND-TRACKING

This project is a computer vision application that leverages machine learning to detect and track hand movements in real-time. It utilizes a hand-tracking algorithm to identify hand landmarks and gestures, making it ideal for applications such as gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, virtual controls, and interactive games.

FEATURES:
- Real-time hand detection and tracking
- Recognition of hand landmarks (e.g., fingers, palm, wrist)
- Basic gesture recognition (e.g., open hand, fist)
- Adjustable parameters to accommodate different hand sizes and environments

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- OpenCV: for image processing
- MediaPipe: for efficient hand tracking
- Python: for development

INSTALLATION

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed, then

Install OpenCV and MediaPipe, along with other dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

Additional Libraries (if necessary)
You may need `numpy` and `matplotlib` for visualization and additional data handling:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

USUAGE:

Once the application is running, it will access your webcam feed and begin tracking your hand. You can adjust parameters in the code to customize tracking sensitivity, hand size, and gesture detection based on your requirements.
